PROBLEM: Predict category classes

For a text document, sometimes we have to find out context from given text. Sometimes classes are hierarchical and model have to predict different levels of classes.
In this problem, the goal is to classify given text in a hierarchy of classes.

Data: Attached is a review of products, you can demonstrate how you approach to classify given text.

Data description:
Product ID: Unique ID of product
Title: Title of review
User  ID: unique ID of user
Time: timestamp of review
Text: Review of the product given by the user
Cat1:  First-level cat
Cat2: Second-level cat
Cat3: third-level cat

Environment: Jupyter notebook, Python 3

Image Processing Assignment:

Problem Description
·       Attached with this mail are SAR images of crop regions.
·       You need to build a segmentation algorithm that can segment different regions of the crop area.
·       Your code will take the crop image as input and the output will be bounding boxes of the crop regions. The bounding boxes can be superimposed on the input image to result in another image.

·       Examples of bounding boxes can be found in Wallerfing_F-SAR_C-band_xl.jpg where you can observe some white coloured boxes. You can approximate the boxes using Hough lines if you wish. 

·       Also label the segmented regions with numbers such that two regions that have similar colour get the same number.
